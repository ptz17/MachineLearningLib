To run the script for this assignment, please follow these steps in the lunix terminal.

1) Clone repository onto local computer running: "git clone https://github.com/ptz17/MachineLearningLib.git"
2) Change directories into "MachineLearningLib/DecisionTree"
3) Change the permissions for the run.sh shell script by running: "chmod u+x run.sh"
4) Execute the shell script using: "./run.sh"

The program may take some time to execute, especially for the portions using the bank dataset. However, at the 
end of execution, average error data is displayed (for both training and testing datasets) using the three heuristics:
entropy, majority error, and the gini index.
